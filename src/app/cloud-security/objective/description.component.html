      Cloud Security Policy
    </h1>
    <p >
      As businesses transition from on-premises solutions to cloud computing, many of them face new challenges in keeping their new cloud infrastructure secure. In this project, I worked as part of a team to draft a corporate Cloud Security Policy and accompanying documents that address risks in a companyâ€™s usage of cloud computing.
